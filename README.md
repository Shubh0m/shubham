###Stuart Johnson's Portfolio

This is the source for my portfolio website at http://thestu.art. It's a Gatsby app hosted on Github pages, if you have any questions feel free to message me. I'm not really interested in licensing, do whatever you want with this. Package it up, edit it, sell it commercially, totally up to you. If you make something cool with it though it'd be nice to know that I helped someone.
